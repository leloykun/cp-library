Stuck w/o solution ideas?
0. Keep calm.
1. Sort the input.
2. Consider the complement of the problem.
3. Find an easier version of the problem (fewer constraints, fewer dimensions).
4. CS solution too ugly? Try math. Or vice versa.
5. Try the following techniques:
    A. Brute force
    B. Brute force with pruning
    C. Greedy
    D. DP
    E. Binary search the answer
    F. Flows
6. Go through list of known data structures and algorithms.

Before you implement!
1. Check the time complexity.
2. Spend an extra O(log n) factor to simplify implementation if it fits time limit. .

Can't find the bug?
0. Keep calm.
1. Check overflow.
2. Check array sizes.
3. Check if arrays were properly initialized.
4. Re-read the code.
5. Print debug information.
6. Brute force to find counterexamples.
